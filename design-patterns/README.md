# design-patterns

- State Pattern vs Strategy Pattern:  
In the state pattern we select one state and based on it we have related implementation for our methods  
But, in the strategy pattern we can use different method related to related object in a convenient way

- State Pattern and Strategy Pattern vs Visitor Pattern:  
State pattern is being used when we have specific number of methods and we want to extend our entities
While visitor pattern is being used while we have almost specific number of entities and we want to extend our methods in one place in a convenient way
